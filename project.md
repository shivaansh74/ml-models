Machine Learning Models Repository
Project Overview
This repository serves as a collection of various machine learning (ML) models, each implemented in Python with clear documentation and use cases. The goal is to provide an easy-to-navigate reference for different ML algorithms, including traditional models, ensemble methods, and deep learning techniques.

Features
Each ML model is implemented in its own file, following a standardized structure.
Jupyter notebooks for visualization and experimentation.
Well-documented code with explanations and real-world use cases.
Example datasets and scripts to test the models.
Instructions on how to run and modify each model.
Planned Models
Linear Regression â€“ Predicting numerical values (e.g., house prices).
Logistic Regression â€“ Binary classification (e.g., spam detection).
Decision Trees â€“ Classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest â€“ Ensemble learning for better accuracy.
K-Means Clustering â€“ Unsupervised learning for customer segmentation.
NaÃ¯ve Bayes â€“ Text classification (e.g., spam filtering).
